# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION FOR RETAIL BUSINESS

## Table of Contents
[Project_overview](#project-overview)

[Data sources](#data-sources)

[Recommendations](#recommendations)


### project overview

To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using data analytics and machine learning algorithms, ultimately developing a recommendation system for targeted marketing strategies.

### Data Source

customer data : The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the customer_data.csv containing detailed informaion about each customer for the retail

### Tools

Excel
Python (for data processing)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms like K-Means and Decision Trees.
Data Visualization:
Tableau/Power BI: To create interactive dashboards to present the customer segments and insights.

### Data Collection

Dataset: Collect customer data, including demographic information, purchase history, and other behavioral metrics. You can find retail datasets on platforms like Kaggle or use company-provided data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and perform initial analyses.
### Executing ML Algorithms: 

K-Means Clustering: Execute the K-means clustering algorithm for the purpose of categorizing customers in relation to their purchase habits 

### Evaluating the Outcomes

Visualize Clusters: Illustrate the clusters formed to facilitate the analysis of customers on various levels. 
Profile Clusters – Study the each customer group in terms of characteristics with the help of features average distribution in each group.

### Recommendation System
These will be specific marketing strategies based on the segmented data for each type of customer - you will need to provide personalized offers and product recommendations, among others.

### limitations

K-Means Clustering Assumption: K-Means also assumes that the shapes of the clusters are spherical and are of the same size. However, in real data, such as customer segmentation, this assumption might not always hold true and may result in wrong clusters being formed.
Clustering with Pre-Determined Number of Clusters (K): In K-Means algorithm, the number of possible clusters must be defined before the analysis begins. Selection of inappropriate number of clusters may result to improper segmentation.
